# Code owner settings for `gcr-build-and-push-action`
# @maintainers should be assigned to all reviews.

# For more info about code owners see https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners#codeowners-file-example
